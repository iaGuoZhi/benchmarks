# SPDP 1.1

SPDP is a compression/decompression algorithm by Martin Burtscher that is tailored towards binary IEEE 754 32-bit single-precision
(float) and 64-bit double-precision (double) floating-point data but also works on other data.

SPDP is included in this repository as third-party code for benchmarking purposes. See `SPDP_11.c` for licensing
details. Small modifications have been made to the code to allow including it as a library.
