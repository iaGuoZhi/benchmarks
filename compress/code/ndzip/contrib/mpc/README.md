# MPC v1.2
MPC is a GPU-based lossless compressor/decompressor by Martin Burtscher written in CUDA for binary IEEE 754 32-bit
single-precision (float) and 64-bit double-precision (double) floating-point data.

MPC is included in this repository as third-party code for benchmarking purposes. See `MPC_float_12.cu` and
`MPC_double_12.cu` for licensing details. Small modifications have been made to the code to allow including it as a
library.
