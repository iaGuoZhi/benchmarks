# GFC v2.2
GFC is a GPU-based compressor/decompressor by Martin Burtscher written in CUDA for binary IEEE 754 64-bit
double-precision floating-point data.

GFC is included in this repository as third-party code for benchmarking purposes. See `GFC_22.cu` for licensing
details. Small modifications have been made to the code to allow including it as a library.
